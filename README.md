# IP and MAC Address Changer

This Python script allows you to change the IP and MAC addresses of your network interface.

## Features

- Change the IP address of your network interface.
- Set a custom MAC address or generate a random one.
- Easy to use with prompts for user input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `subprocess` module (part of the Python standard library)
- `macchanger` (if you want to generate a random MAC address)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/atikhasan27000/macchanger.git
    ```

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

3. Run the script:

    ```sh
    python3 macchanger.py
    ```

    You will be prompted to enter the IP address and optionally a custom MAC address. If you leave the MAC address blank, a random MAC address will be generated.
